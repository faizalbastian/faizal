## 🚀 About Me
I'm a curious developer who loves experimenting with code — from building automation bots to analyzing data and creating research-based tech projects.

🧠 I enjoy:
- Automating repetitive tasks with **Python scripts**
- Exploring **AI models** and **data-driven systems**
- Learning how real-world systems (like networks & sensors) connect with software
- Writing clean documentation & technical reports
